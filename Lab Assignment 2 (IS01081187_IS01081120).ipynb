    "- Naive Bayes Accuracy: 0.7917337344204907\n",
    "- SVM Accuracy:  0.8923661503549094\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Lexicon-Based Approach (VADER)\n",
    "\n",
    "  STRENGTHS\n",
    "  - This approach boasts a high accuracy indicating LBA is effective in classifying sentiment based on predefined word lists.\n",
    "  - It is also easy to understand and implement by simply identifying which words contribute to the respective sentiments and performs well for basic sentiment analysis tasks.\n",
    "  - VADER provides a compound score indicating the sentiment intensity, providing a more refined understanding of the expressed sentiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "  WEAKNESSES\n",
    "  - Vader can handle some informal language but it might struggle with complex sentence structures, sarcasm or heavily context-dependent sentiment.\n",
    "  - Vader relies solely on word presence where it might miss the impact of word order, negation or irony on sentiment. \n",
    "  - The effectiveness of Vader depends on the text domain where it might not be as accurate for formal writing ot technical writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ML-Based Approach (Naive Bayes)\n",
    "\n",
    "  STRENGTHS\n",
    "  - It is one of the simple algoritm to understand and implement. Training this type of model is computationally efficient which is ideal for tasks where fast training on large datasets is crucial.\n",
    "  - It scales will with increasing data sized as the model can efficiently retrain wihtout significant performance degradation.\n",
    "  - It can handle both continuous and discrete data types effectively which is useful for sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "  WEAKNESSES\n",
    "  - It records the lowest accuracy compared to LBA and SVM classifier in this model.\n",
    "  - The performance of Naive Bayes can highly depend on feature selection and preprocessing. Choosing the right features and appropriate data preparation can impact its accuracy.\n",
    "  - It might struggle to accurately identify the less frequent class depending on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ML-Based Approach (SVM classifier)\n",
    "\n",
    "  STRENGTHS\n",
    "  - The SVM classifier demonstrates the highest accuracy among the models, proving its ability to handle complex relationship between features. This allows them to learn intricate patterns in the data which leads to more precise classifications.\n",
    "  - SVMs can utilize kernel functions to map data into higher dimension and handle non-linear relationships between features which is valuable for sentiment analysis. \n",
    "  - SVMs can learn decision boundaties are more robust to noise and outliers in the data by maximizing margin which is increasing the confidence level of the classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "WEAKNESSES\n",
    "- SVMs can overfit the training data that can lead to poor performance on unseen data. \n",
    "- It is more difficult to understand and interpret compared to other models.\n",
    "- It consumes more training time as the it deals with large datasets or complex kernel functions which is not ideal for real-time applications."
